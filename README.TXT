Everything except the competition part is done in the file "ass4.py". Is can receive the following parameters:
'-tr': File name of the training data. Its default value is "train_examples.tsv".
'-d': File name of the development data.Its default value is "dev_examples.tsv",
'-t': File name of the test data. Its default value is "test_examples.tsv".
'-w': File name of the output. Its default value is None.
'-b': Whether you want to bin the features or not. Its default value is False
'-c': Classifier already trained. Its default value is None.

I have been running the file as: python ass4.py -w info.txt. Doing so I got almost all the printed information in that file.
